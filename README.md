Why
==
In a nutshell, there are many awesome lists in the sindresorhus/awesome.
We hope to build an application to access them more quickly.  
That's why "Awesome Search" was born. :octocat:

Features
==
✔ Access and search every awesome repo collected in [sindresorhus/awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) in one page quickly.   
✔ Access an awesome repo by `https://dev.awesomelists.top/#/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs`. (you can BOOKMARK it!)  
✔ Use Github API to retrieve README file of an awesome repo, so it's up-to-date.  

Supported awesome lists
==
You can see the JSON format of links [here](https://github.com/lockys/Awesome.json/blob/master/awesome/awesome.json).
[awesome.json](https://github.com/lockys/awesome.json) file is the place where the data stores for now.
